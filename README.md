The Temple Management System is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to automate and streamline the
operations of the Shree Mahalaxmi Temple in Kolhapur. This online portal allows devotees to book darshan slots,
schedule worship, rituals and make donations to the temple. The platform enables devotees to check the availability
of slots for their chosen date, ensuring a seamless booking experience. Additionally, the system provides temple
administrators with tools to manage darshan bookings, track donations, and maintain detailed records of devotees.
